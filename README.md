#### *Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice where IT infrastructure—such as virtual machines, networks, load balancers, and databases—is managed and provisioned through code instead of manual processes.*

#### IaC allows DevOps engineers to:

* Define infrastructure in declarative or imperative code
* Deploy infrastructure consistently without manual steps
* Version-control infra changes just like application code
* Automate provisioning, scaling, and configuration

#### Benefits of IaC

* Faster deployments
* Reduced manual effort
* Lower operational cost
* Lower risk & fewer misconfigurations
* Highly repeatable & reliable infra setup
* Easy rollback using Git

#### Why IaC Matters

* Managing infrastructure manually leads to:
* Errors and inconsistent configurations
* Slow deployments
* High maintenance overhead
* Difficulty scaling and version-controlling changes
* IaC solves this by turning infrastructure into automated, repeatable code.

### Terraform with IaC

#### Terraform automates the way infrastructure is defined and deployed across cloud environments. It supports a wide range of public cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and OCI.

### *Terraform Core Tool for IaC*

Terraform is one of the most widely used IaC tools. It enables you to:

* Write infrastructure definitions using HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)
* Deploy cloud resources across providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
* Plan changes before applying using terraform plan
* Manage infra state using terraform.tfstate
* Ensure predictable deployments using modules and workspaces
